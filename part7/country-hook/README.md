# Countries exercises with custom hooks

In this exercise, we made a new version of the countries exercise from `Part 2` using custom hooks.

This application is used to search for country details from the https://studies.cs.helsinki.fi/restcountries/ API. If country is found, the details of the country are displayed.

## Running the Application

```bash
# Install the necessary dependencies
$ npm install

# Start the application
$ npm run dev
```

You can then access the app on: [http://localhost:5173/](http://localhost:5173/)
