# University of Helsinki - Full Stack Open 2024

This repository contains my assignment submissions for Helsinki University
[Full Stack Open 2024](https://fullstackopen.com/en/).

The course is on modern JavaScript-based Web Development. The main focus is on building single page
applications with ReactJS that use REST APIs built with Node.js.

The course also contains additional sections for the following:

- GraphQL, a modern alternative to REST APIs.
- TypeScript, an open-source typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript.
- React Native, an open-source UI software framework to create native mobile applications using
  JavaScript. (not completed yet)
- CI/CD - Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Delivery (CD)
- Docker Containers, an open platform for developing, shipping, and running applications by
  virtualizing the operating system of the computer on which it is installed and running.
- Relational databases.
