# Navigate to the backend server directory
$ cd part9/patientor-server

# Install the necessary dependencies
$ npm install

# Start the server
$ npm run dev
```

Then, in a new terminal window, navigate back to `part9/patientor-client` directory and do the following:

```bash
# Navigate to the frontend directory
$ cd part9/patientor-client
