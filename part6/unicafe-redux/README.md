# Unicafe - Redux

In this exercise, we've created a streamlined version of the Unicafe exercise from Part 1, with state management handled by `Redux`. To recap, the Unicafe application gathers customer feedback through three options: good, neutral, and bad.

## Running the Application

```bash
# Install the necessary dependencies
$ npm install

# Start the application
$ npm run dev
```

You can then access the app on: [http://localhost:5173/](http://localhost:5173/)
